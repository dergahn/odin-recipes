<h3>What is Bruschetta?</h3>
<p>
  Bruschetta (pronounced brew-SKET-tah) is an Italian appetizer or antipasti
  that starts with a base of toasted or grilled bread. The bread is then served
  warm either with a topping spooned over or with a topping on the side so each
  person can build their own bruschetta. Bruschetta is meant to be served as a
  hand-held finger food, large enough for one or two bites.
